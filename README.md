### 2 - Pull the TradingView submodule

> *NOTE: Skip this part if you do not want to show the trading chart or have no access rights to the `TradingView` repository*

The [TradingView](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library) repository is the submodule of this repository which is used for displaying the trading chart of a specific martket and initialized at `src/frontend/public/static`.

In essence, adding the `TradingView` as a submodule is that you are cloning the `TradingView` repository and build it into static files. Therefore, you need to have the access rights to the `TradingView` repository.

Moreover, the submodule path is set up to use SSH protocol with the `github.com` hostname so that you need to manage your SSH keys to make sure that you are using the correct configuration.

#### If you have not had any SSH keys

Follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to generate one

In order to make this repository to be able to use the `TradingView`, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
